# OIDC Provider

This project defines the auth provider used locally when the grid has been set-up using the `--with-local-auth` flag.

It is intended for **use in development only**.

See the docs for [set up](/docs/01-setup/03-running-setup.md#--with-local-auth) and [running the grid locally](/docs/02-running/01-running-locally.md#accessing-grid) for more details how to use this.
